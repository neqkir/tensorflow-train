# ======================================================================
# There are 5 questions in this exam with increasing difficulty from 1-5.
# Please note that the weight of the grade for the question is relative
# to its difficulty. So your Category 1 question will score significantly
# less than your Category 5 question.
#
# Don't use lambda layers in your model.
# You do not need them to solve the question.
# Lambda layers are not supported by the grading infrastructure.
#
# You must use the Submit and Test button to submit your model
# at least once in this category before you finally submit your exam,
# otherwise you will score zero for this category.

# NLP QUESTION
#
# Build and train a classifier for the sarcasm dataset.
# The classifier should have a final layer with 1 neuron activated by sigmoid as shown.
# It will be tested against a number of sentences that the network hasn't previously seen
# and you will be scored on whether sarcasm was correctly detected in those sentences.
